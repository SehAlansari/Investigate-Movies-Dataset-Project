# Investigate-Movies-Dataset-Project

about the data:
Introduction:
Data that I'm going to Investigate is about movies that involve (name of the movie, actors, directors, budgets, rating, revenue ...Features). the investigation is going to cover the following questions:

1- What are the types of movies required/have the most budget?

2- Do these movies with highest budget casted the most votes regarding rating?

3- Does comedy movies bring more revenue than drama ones and does it impact popularity?

Conclusions

1: The three categories of movies that required the largest budget amount among all categories (types of movies) are Action movies, adventure movies, and fantasy movies. The reason for these categories to require a massive budget is that those types of movies need more offers, dangerous scenes, a lot of types of equipment, and Technology specialists staff to reach the final image of a great, worth-to-watch type of movie with a realistic view.

2: Movie budget does not impact the rating of a movie, a movie can have a large amount of budget yet cast fewer votes in comparison to a small-budget movie that has a top rating. Therefore, there is no dependency between these factors.

3: Comedy movies brought more revenue than drama ones while the popularity and rating are not impacted at all by the revenue.

Limitations

1: some movies have budget zero or revenue zero or both which not realistic at all. each movie requires these kind factors for example revenue should be impacted by how many people did attened a particular movie which can affect the papulority and rating factors.

2: some movies have budget and revenue but lack of having cast and directors names. In this project i replaced null value of cast and Director with not-specified in-order not to imapct the overall amount of budget or revenue for each Category of movie. but sill not Suitable all the time specilly if the names impact on sequence of the analysis process.
